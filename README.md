### _Summary_
- <font color=cyan>_*Stats Savvy*_</font> ([math-skils](https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/intra/kisumu/module/math-skills?event=87)) calculates and prints the average, median, variance, and standard deviation of a given dataset from a provided file. Usage To run the program, use the following command:

```
bash
$> go run your-program.go data.txt
```

- Replace your-program.go with the name of your Go program and data.txt with the path to your data file. Data Format The data file should contain one value per line, with each line representing a single data point. For example:

189

113

121

114

145

110

...

Output : 

The program will print the results of each calculation in the following format:

```
Average: <average_value>
Median: <median_value>
Variance: <variance_value>
Standard Deviation: <standard_deviation_value>
```

Example :

```
Average: 35
Median: 4
Variance: 5
Standard Deviation: 65
```
